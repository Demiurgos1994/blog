Hi, welcome to Slow Fetch!

My name is Aleksa Bozicic. 

I am from Serbia and I am 27 years old. I enjoy coding, learning about machine learning and field of data analytics and data science.

I have studied physics in college, and started working at digital advertising agency back in 2017 as PPC account manager.

After a while I got interested in analytics side of advertising and decided to master Google Analytics and GTM.

Over the years I have worked for a lot of different companies, either as a PPC consultant or web analytics consultant. 
Here is a list of few:
* [CitizenShipper](https://citizenshipper.com/)
* [ThihkMarkets](https://www.thinkmarkets.com/)
* [RushPCB](https://rushpcbinc.com/)
* [Iboux](https://iboux.com/)
* [Cosy House Collection](https://www.cosyhousecollection.com/)


Now I am a co-owner of an agency called [ScalersPPC](https://www.scalersppc.com/) where I serve as head of analytics.

I am still learning new things and this blog is all about that.

On my journey, I have learned a lot from people who decided to give their knowledge away for free and I am eternally grateful, so on this blog I am trying to do the same and give back.
I hope you find it useful.

Lastly, I am always open to suggestions and potential collaborations, you can reach me trough email or LinkedIn, both of which are linked in the home page.
